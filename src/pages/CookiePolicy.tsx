    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help us remember your preferences, keep you signed in, and understand how you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Functional Cookies</strong> – necessary for core features such as authentication and session management (e.g., Supabase auth tokens).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong> – help us understand usage patterns so we can improve the Service. We currently use a privacy-focused analytics provider that does not track individual users.</li>
      <li><strong>Preference Cookies</strong> – remember UI settings like dark mode.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
    <p>You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some features of PlanMyEscape may not function properly without them.</p>
