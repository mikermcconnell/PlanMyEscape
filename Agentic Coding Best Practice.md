# Agentic Coding Best Practices

A comprehensive guide to using Claude Code agents for systematic, high-quality software development.

## üéØ Overview

Agentic coding leverages specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of software development systematically. This approach ensures consistent quality, reduces errors, and provides structured workflows for complex development tasks.

## üß™ Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### **Purpose**
Write tests before implementation to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and create living documentation.

### **When to Use**
- **Trigger**: User says "Test-Driven Development: [feature description]"
- **Best For**: New features, bug fixes, API endpoints, complex business logic
- **Benefits**: Higher code quality, better test coverage, fewer bugs, clear requirements

### **The Five-Phase TDD Pattern**

| Phase | Action | Tools/Agents | Deliverable |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **üß™ Test Design** | Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementation | `test-engineer`, `Write` | Complete test suite |
| **üî¥ Verify Failures** | Confirm all tests fail (red state) | `npm test`, bash commands | Failing tests confirmed |
| **‚úÖ Implement** | Write minimal code to make tests pass | `backend-implementer`, `ui-engineer` | Passing implementation |
| **üîÑ Iterate** | Code iteratively until all tests green | Continue implementation | All tests green |
| **üîç Verify Quality** | Review implementation and test coverage | `code-reviewer` | Quality-verified code |

### **TDD Workflow Commands**
```bash
# Phase 1: Always start with tests
"Test-Driven Development: Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Phase 2: Verify red state  
"Run tests to confirm they fail as expected"

# Phase 3-4: Implementation
"Implement minimal code to make all tests pass"

# Phase 5: Quality assurance
"Review TDD implementation for quality and coverage"
```

### **TDD Best Practices**
- **Tests First**: Never write implementation before tests
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to make tests pass
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Ensure tests fail, make them pass, then refactor
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test edge cases, error conditions, and happy paths
- **Living Documentation**: Tests should clearly explain expected behavior

## üß† Task Think Workflow

### **Purpose**
Systematic approach for complex development tasks requiring analysis, planning, and careful implementation.

### **When to Use**
- **Trigger**: User says "Task Think" or tasks involve multiple files/components
- **Best For**: Complex features, refactoring, architectural changes, unfamiliar codebases
- **Benefits**: Context awareness, reduced errors, better solutions, systematic progress

### **The Four-Phase Pattern**

| Phase | Action | Tools/Keywords | Deliverable |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **üîç Explore** | Read relevant files, understand codebase context | `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Context understanding |
| **üß† Plan** | Think through solution with appropriate depth | `sequential-thinking` | Detailed implementation plan |
| **‚ö° Implement** | Code the planned solution based on analysis | `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` | Working implementation |
| **üîó Integration** | Commit changes, create PRs, verify functionality | `Bash (git)`, tests, linting | Integrated feature |

### **Task Think Commands**
```bash
# Trigger the workflow
"Task Think: Refactor authentication system to support multiple providers"

# Optional depth modifiers
"Task Think harder: Implement complex data synchronization between microservices"
```

### **Task Think Best Practices**
- **No Premature Coding**: Always explore and plan before implementing
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track progress through each phase
- **Deep Analysis**: Read existing code to understand patterns and conventions
- **Sequential Planning**: Use structured thinking to reason through solutions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain understanding of the broader system impact

## üéØ Task Router Agent

### **Purpose**
Automatically analyze tasks and assign them to the most appropriate specialized agent for optimal results.

### **When to Use**
- **Trigger**: "Route this task" or when unsure which agent to use
- **Best For**: Complex tasks that might need multiple agents, ambiguous requirements
- **Benefits**: Optimal agent selection, reduced cognitive overhead, systematic task breakdown

### **Router Decision Matrix**

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Frontend UI** | `ui-engineer` | `test-engineer`, `code-reviewer` | React components, styling, interactions |
| **Backend Logic** | `backend-implementer` | `test-engineer`, `security-specialist` | APIs, data processing, services |
| **Database Work** | `firebase-specialist` | `security-specialist`, `performance-optimizer` | Schema, queries, migrations |
| **Testing** | `test-engineer` | `debugger`, `performance-optimizer` | Test suites, coverage, mocking |
| **Performance** | `performance-optimizer` | `debugger`, `code-reviewer` | Optimization, profiling, bottlenecks |
| **Security** | `security-specialist` | `code-reviewer`, `test-engineer` | Vulnerability analysis, secure coding |
| **DevOps** | `devops-engineer` | `security-specialist` | Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure |
| **Planning** | `planner-agent` | `task-router` | Feature breakdown, estimation |
| **Code Review** | `code-reviewer` | `security-specialist`, `test-engineer` | Quality assurance, best practices |

### **Router Commands**
```bash
# Let router decide optimal approach
"Route this task: Build a real-time chat system with end-to-end encryption"

# Router with specific constraints
"Route this task with security focus: Implement user file upload functionality"

# Multi-phase routing
"Route this complex task: Migrate from REST to GraphQL with zero downtime"
```

### **Router Best Practices**
- **Trust the Router**: Let it analyze and assign rather than pre-selecting agents
- **Provide Context**: Give detailed task descriptions for better routing decisions
- **Sequential Routing**: Complex tasks may need multiple agents in sequence
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Router ensures agents work together effectively
- **Quality Gates**: Router includes appropriate review and testing agents

## üîÑ Combining Methodologies

### **TDD + Task Think**
```bash
"Task Think with Test-Driven Development: Implement OAuth2 authentication flow"
```
1. **Explore**: Analyze existing auth patterns
2. **Plan**: Design OAuth2 integration approach  
3. **Test Design**: Write comprehensive OAuth2 tests
4. **Implement**: Build to pass tests
5. **Integration**: Deploy and verify

### **Router + TDD**
```bash
"Route this TDD task: Build payment processing with Stripe integration"
```
1. **Route Analysis**: Router selects backend-implementer + security-specialist + test-engineer
2. **Test Design**: test-engineer creates payment tests
3. **Security Review**: security-specialist reviews payment handling
4. **Implementation**: backend-implementer builds Stripe integration
5. **Quality Review**: code-reviewer verifies final implementation

### **All Three Combined**
```bash
"Task Think with TDD routing: Redesign user dashboard with real-time analytics"
```
1. **Exploration**: Analyze current dashboard and analytics requirements
2. **Routing**: task-router assigns ui-engineer + performance-optimizer + test-engineer
3. **Planning**: Sequential thinking through dashboard redesign approach
4. **Test Design**: Comprehensive test suite for new dashboard
5. **Implementation**: Build dashboard with real-time features
6. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time data handling
7. **Integration**: Deploy with monitoring and verification
