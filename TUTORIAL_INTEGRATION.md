## Integration Options

### Option 1: Entry Point Integration (Recommended)
Replace your main app's entry point to show the tutorial first:

```javascript
// In src/App.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [showTutorial, setShowTutorial] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if user has seen tutorial
    const hasSeenTutorial = localStorage.getItem('planmyescape-tutorial-completed');
    if (hasSeenTutorial) {
      setShowTutorial(false);
    }
  }, []);

  if (showTutorial) {
    // Redirect to tutorial
    window.location.href = '/tutorial.html';
    return null;
  }

  // Your existing app code
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      {/* Your existing routes */}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### Option 2: Route-Based Integration
Add tutorial as a route in your React app:

```javascript
// Add to your routes
<Route path="/tutorial" element={<TutorialLanding />} />
<Route path="/welcome" element={<TutorialLanding />} />
```

### Option 3: Standalone Landing Page
Use as a separate marketing/onboarding page:
- Host at `yourdomain.com/tutorial`
- Link from marketing materials
- Use as app introduction for new users
